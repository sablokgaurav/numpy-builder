the numpy options in this are:
    1. arange: provides the range implementation of numpy
    2. add provides how to apply the add acorss numpy arrays
    3. subtract provides how to apply across the numpy arrays
    4. multiply provides how to apply multiply across the numpy arrays
    5.divide provides how to apply divide across the numpy arrays
    6.reciprocal provides how to apply reciprocal across the numpy arrays
    7.power provides how to apply power across the numpy arrays
    8.mod provides how to apply mod or remainder across the numpy arrays
    9.sum provides how to apply sum across the numpy arrays
